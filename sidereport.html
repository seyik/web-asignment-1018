    When I first started the course in September, I had no idea what to expect, and because I was still in college, I assumed it would be the same as the topic I did in my course I had chosen in college, but it was somewhat similar. It was similar because I did some HTML, but the code was provided to us. However, when we first started this course, we had to type our own code, which was difficult because I had no idea what this code was supposed to do. However, after a while, I began to understand the code and what it did. I used colours such as brown to match the tone and appearance of my website as my website is based on Nigerian cuisine. My teacher Chris, however, was instrumental in my success.

    I ran into some coding issues when I was creating my blog page because my navigation bar didn't show up, which meant I couldn't navigate from the blog page, so I had to go through the code and correct the errors to ensure that my navigation bar worked. With the exception of the home page, every page I created was designed to appeal to the user who was viewing it. I was having trouble with the homepage because my picture was too large, and I wanted to shrink it and align it in the centre of the page, but with the help of a classmate, I was able to solve the problem.
